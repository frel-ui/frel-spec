# Introducing Frel

I hate two things in programming: specifications written in plain English and boilerplate code.

Unfortunately, this also means that AI coding assistants brought my worst nightmares into life: we write specifications in plain English and build extremely sophisticated agentic systems to turn them into boilerplate. A bit ironic... :D

To escape from this hellish future I started to work on a DSL (domain 
specific language) which tries to find a middle ground: 

1. Something I can easily read.
2. Lets me write down all information needed for showing a user interface.
3. A computer can easily understand without actual AI.
