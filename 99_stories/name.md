# Why Frel?

While I was working on the predecessor of this project, which was called Adaptive 
and has been written in Kotlin, I wanted a mascot for the project and came up with a leaf.

I like nature, I like the color green. Also, I've been able to imagine that the 
leaf then could be a branch, a tree, a grove (IDE) and eventually a forest (cloud).

This helped me imagine how far the project could grow. While it did grow quit a bit 
(100+ KLOC, mostly manually written, not AI), I’ve never publicized it much, and I've 
decided to switch to Rust before making it ready for the public.

While working on Adaptive, I started to use the phrase "Adaptive is a Friendly Leaf".

I don't really know why this stuck in my head, but it did. Whenever I was thinking
about describing the project, I would start with "Adaptive is a Friendly Leaf."

First, the Rust port name was simply "adaptive-rs." But the name ‘adaptive’ was already 
taken on crates.io and the domain was hard to get.

So, I started to find another name, asked ChatGPT for suggestions, but there
was nothing I was really happy with.

Then one afternoon, walking from the office to home, I've been thinking about
what name to choose, and of course, the "Friendly Leaf" popped up again.

I've thought: why not use the acronym of this? It comes up all the time anyway.
It's a small detail that "friend" starts with "fri" not "fre"—something I 
honestly didn’t notice at the time.

So, Frel actually stands for "Friendly Leaf" with a bit of a spelling mistake.
