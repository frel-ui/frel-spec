# Frel DSL

This document is not a user guide but a specification of the Frel DSL. Definitions
introduced in the other part of the documentation are simply referenced here.

**Frel DSL**: A declarative language for describing fragment templates, visual themes and resources.

**Fragment template**: Declaration of a reusable component that compiles to Fragment IR and 
is instantiated at runtime as a fragment. Its surface breaks down into a name, parameters, 
and a body of DSL statements that construct layout, state, and logic.

**Theme**: A reusable styling configuration to be used with a fragment template.

**Resource**: A reusable UI assed to be used with a fragment template.

> [!NOTE] 
>
> While the main language of the library is Rust, the DSL is quite independent of the
> main language. Only calculations and event handlers are written in Rust, the general 
> syntax and the control statements are intentionally different from the Rust syntax.
> The reason behind this is to avoid confusion and unambiguity.

## Hosts

**Host Language:** The programming language that is used for expressions and statements in the DSL,
also the target language for the generated Fragment IR. Each host language needs a compile-time
plugin that translates the DSL into Fragment IR.

**Host Language Expression (HLE):** An expression that is written in the host language. These
are used in the DSL to construct the fragment's logic. Expressions evaluate to a value.

**Pure HLE (PHLE):** An expression that is written in the host language and does not have any
side effects. Pure HLE expressions are allowed in the DSL body for store initializers, derived
stores, fragment parameters, and control flow conditions.

**Host Language Statement (HLS):** A statement that is written in the host language. Statements
may have side effects (assignments, I/O, control flow, etc.). HLS are only allowed inside event
handler bodies.

**Host Platform:** The UI platform that the host language runs on. This can be "browser",
Android, iOS, GTK, skia etc. Each host platform needs a runtime adapter that provides
the necessary integrations.

## Syntax

The templates are defined using the `fragment` keyword and use the DSL syntax specified below.

A fragment template is composed of:

- a name
- zero or more parameters
- body that contains zero or more statements

```text
<fragment> ::= "fragment" <name> "(" [ <param-list> ] ")" "{" <body> "}"
<param-list> ::= <param> { "," <param> }
<param> ::= <param-name> ":" <param-type>
<body> ::= { <statement> }
```

### Name

**Definition** 

`<name>` is the identifier of the fragment template; it is the symbol used to refer
to (instantiate) the template from other templates. It exists at compile time and does not create
a runtime instance by itself.

**Rules**

- `<name>` must be a valid Rust identifier (case-sensitive, not a Rust keyword).

### Parameters

**Definition** 

Each `<param>` declares an external store the fragment reads from (data it does not own).
Parameters supply inputs and wiring for reactivity from parents into the fragment.

**Rules**

- `<param-name>` must be a valid Rust identifier.
- `<param-type>` must be a valid Rust type (path/type expression).
- Lifetimes are not supported in parameter types (e.g., `&'a str`, `Foo<'a>` are rejected), as 
  they do not translate cleanly to the reactive app-state model.
- Generics: Generic types are allowed without lifetimes (e.g., Vec<String>, Option<u32>).

### Body

**Definition**

`<body>` is a sequence of DSL statements that build the fragment's structure and behavior. 

**Rules**

- The body may be empty.
- When present, statements must conform to the DSLâ€™s statement categories and their respective semantics (reactive/pure expression constraints, etc.).

**Statements**

- [**Store declarations**](20_reactive_state/10_store_basics.md)
- [**Fragment creation**](20_fragment_creation.md)
- [**Control statements**](30_control_statements.md)
- [**Instructions**](40_instructions.md)
- [**Event handlers**](45_event_handlers.md)
- [**Detached UI**](50_detached_ui.md)

## Example

```frel
fragment Counter(label: String) {
    decl count = 0

    column {
        padding { 16 } .. border { Red, 1 }

        button {
            on_click { count = count + 1 }
            text { "Click me" }
        }

        text { "${label}: ${count}" } .. text_small
    }
}
```
