The Frel project considers naming one of the utmost important aspects of its design.

All names **MUST** be chosen very carefully to avoid misunderstandings and confusion.

We prefer **deliberately non-intuitive** names in some contexts when we want to force
the reader to **NOT ASSUME** something.

For example, `mut` is a keyword in Rust which have a very specific meaning. If we do not
assign the **exact same** meaning to `mut`, we should not use it.

**CRITICAL**: Do not propose or perform naming changes without being asked exactly.
