# Frel Specifications and Software Designs

Frel is currently in the **planning and early design** stage.

The repository serves as a place to **document ideas, architecture drafts**.

>
> [!NOTE]

> Frel started as a Rust library, and some plans are still Rust-related. That said, I was thinking
> about how AI code assistants will change coding. Should I keep to Rust, should I switch to 
> TypeScript, or go back and use Kotlin? I realized that almost all concepts in the plans are
> language-agnostic. Why not start with a language-agnostic design from the beginning?

For actual implementations see other repositories under [frel-ui](https://github.com/frel-ui).

Expect:

- Rapidly changing concepts and structures
- Discussions and design documents instead of working examples

## Contributing

Early feedback on design direction, architecture, and API ideas is welcome through
GitHub discussions or issues. Once the design stabilizes, contribution guidelines will be added.
