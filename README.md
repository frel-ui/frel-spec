# Frel

Frel is a declarative DSL for building reactive, platform-independent user interfaces,
focused on intent rather than implementation details.

The **Frel Compiler** compiles Frel to multiple host languages (Rust, TypeScript, Kotlin).

The **Frel Runtime** manages reactivity and renders the UI to multiple platforms (web,
native mobile, desktop, PDF).

Frel emphasizes a compact runtime footprint, deterministic rendering, and clean separation
between declarative UI definitions and platform-specific adapters.

Key features:

- Declarative, reactive UI components
- Programming language agnostic (host language independent)
- Platform agnostic (web, mobile, desktop, documents)
- Compact runtime with minimal overhead

## Status

Frel is currently in the **planning and early design** stage.

Expect:

- Rapidly changing concepts and structures
- Discussions and design documents instead of working examples

## Contributing

Early feedback on design direction, architecture, and API ideas is welcome through
GitHub discussions or issues. Once the design stabilizes, contribution guidelines will be added.
