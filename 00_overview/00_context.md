# Context

This design draft is for a Rust UI library I'm working on. It is built from
a number of smaller files, `# File: 00_overview/00_context.md` specifies the
file of the following content.

The draft is not yet complete, many details are missing, don't worry about those if I 
do not ask specifically.

Generate code only when I ask for it. We are in the design and planning phase.

Ask as many clarification questions as you need.
